# Fiber Network Node RPC

The RPC module provides a set of APIs for developers to interact with FNN. Please note that APIs are not stable yet and may change in the future.

Allowing arbitrary machines to access the JSON-RPC port (using the `rpc.listening_addr` configuration option) is **dangerous and strongly discouraged**. Please strictly limit the access to only trusted machines.

You may refer to the e2e test cases in the `tests/bruno/e2e` directory for examples of how to use the RPC.
